                <h2>What's a Hackathon?</h2>
                <p>
                    A hackathon brings together tech enthusiasts and
                    professionals from diverse industries to identify and solve
                    problems through technology - usually all in the course of a
                    weekend.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If this your first hackathon, don’t worry! This is a great
                    place to start building. We will have mentors here to help
                    you every step of the way. We will have prizes for newcomers
                    too.
